RULES SPECIF OF THE SYSTEM, YOU MUST FOLLOW THEM FOR THE GENERATION:\n","    - Global admins are just \"admin\", they do not belong to any team. Do not use the function `team_role` for global admins. Instead, use `subject.global_role`.\n","    - The valid actions that Team Admins can perform on team users are: `read`, `write`, `write_role`, and `change_password`. If this request is present, consider these actions. In case like: Team admins can perform all operations on the team users (except delete) do not use negation, but only positive way to rapresent the consept, omitting \"delete\" in the array is the only correct solution, do not use negation like \"action!=delete\" if the natural language specify that someone can't delete, istead use action == [change_password, write, write_role, read][_], the same goes for any action.\n","    - \"extra_roles\" attribute sometimes is part of the \"SUBJECT\" and should be used in the rego if the natural language mention an extra role.\n","    - \"base_roles\" attribute sometimes is part of the \"SUBJECT\" and should be used in the rego if the natural language mention an extra role.\n","    - Sometimes \"ACTION\" can be \"list\", in that case instead of \"action\" attribute use the function allowed_list_roles.\n","    - IMPORTANT: Use team_role only when \"Team Admin\" or \"Team Admins\" are present (not just \"team\" as object.type or just \"admin\", in that case use standard Instead, use `subject.global_role`.)\n","    - IMPORTANT: Use \"allowed_read_roles\" only then the natural language ACTION is selective_read.\n","    - IMPORTANT: use \"allowed_list_roles\" only then the natural language ACTION is list and/or selective_list\n","    - IMPORTANT: use \"team_role\" only if (one of) the SUBJECT is \"Team Admin\", do not use team_role for any other role! (with Global admin, observer, admin etc DO NOT USE team_role)\n","    - IMPORTANT: If you include \"team_role\" with \"object.team_id\" in the generation, you must include the check on \"not is_null(object.team_id)\" attribute.\n","    - IMPORTANT: if object.type == \"team\", YOU DON'T USE \"team_role\", use \"team_role\" only when SUBJECT is \"Team Admin\"!!\n","    - IMPORTANT: if object.type == \"team\" add a check on \"object.id != 0\"\n","    - IMPORTANT: use \"not is_null(object.team_id)\" only and always if you use team_role() and \"object.team_id\" is present as argument.\n","    - IMPORTANT: if there is \"target teams\" in natural language you must add the check is_null(object.host_targets.teams)\n","    - IMPORTANT: do not include the check on is_null(object.team_id) is object.team_is is not an argument of team_role.\n","\n","\n","\n","Step 5:\n","- Output ONLY the corrisponing rego code, use ONLY one block of allow (no else/or), follow all the rules specified before (1 RULES FOR YOUR GENERATION and 2.
