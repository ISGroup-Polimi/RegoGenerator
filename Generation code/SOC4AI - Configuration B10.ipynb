To find the match, look at the new policy OBJECT's natural language and the retrieved OBJECT in natural language and in rego and if one of them is sintattically similar (minor small changes, ignoring minor lexical variations such as underscores, spaces, or plurals) copy for the new policy's \"object.type\" (or the corrisponing rego regarding the OBJECT) the object.type from the retrieved policy.\n","A.

RULES FOR YOUR GENERATION:\n","    - Generate syntactically valid and properly formatted Rego code.\n","    - Produce only ONE allow block, do not use formulation with multiple blocks (ex. DO NOT USE MORE THAN 1 allow OR ANY else/or).\n","    - Copy object.type from a retrieved policy when the OBJECT matches the OBJECT of the new policy's natural language (as shown before).\n","    - Do not invent object.type's value but use exaclty the rego value retrieved. Minor changes ARE NOT permitted.\n","    - IF YOU FIND A POLICY WITH THE MATCHED OBJECT COPY THE REGO VALUE , EVEN IF SUBJECT OR ACTION DON'T MATCH.\n","    - Maintain consistency in spacing, indentation, and formatting with the retrieved policies.\n","    - Do not invent any new fields, attributes, or values.\n","    - Do not invent new types and do not use the object.type directly from the natural language query.\n","    - DO NOT ADD ANY COMMENTS IN THE GENERATED REGO\n","    - DO not skip any roles.\n","    - Do not use negation, DO NOT USE \"action !=read\", negation on attributes are not permited; use only positive expressions like \"action == write\" even if the natural language specify a negation of an exept.\n","    - Do not repeat the same attribute.\n","    - Don't use array when the value of one attribute is just one, use just the direct value.\n","\n","\n","  2.

If this request is present, consider these actions. In case like: Team admins can perform all operations on the team users (except delete) do not use negation, but only positive way to rapresent the consept, omitting \"delete\" in the array is the only correct solution, do not use negation like \"action!=delete\" if the natural language specify that someone can't delete, istead use action == [change_password, write, write_role, read][_], the same goes for any action.\n","    - The valid actions that Global Admins can perform ON USERS are ONLY: `read`, `write`, `write_role`, and `change_password`.
