# RegoGenerator
Rego Generation Pipeline for Authorization Policies using LLM

The repo contains different generation examples, each including its corresponding pickle files resulting from the various stages of the pipeline + the pipeline as a ipynb file.

All examples are based on the same dataset but use different configurations in how the policies are distributed between the knowledge base and the test set. These configurations are determined using a random parameter, keeping the 80:20 distribution ratio.

If an “Invalid Notebook” error occurs, please download the file.
